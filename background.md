# Background

Risk control in the securities market is one of the most attractive topics in finance.
Unfortunately, previous studies have been mainly studying various machine learning
algorithms to enhance predictive accuracy (e.g., precision, recall, AUC et cetera). Such
overly pursuing accuracy generates a significant gap between the industry and
academia. Essentially, stock traders and analysts are not satisfied with a winning
number obtained from the predicted result. They are eager to unveil the mysterious
power to cause the predicted results and make a final judgment with their professional
knowledge and senses since the predicted results are not always correct. The challenge
lies in the black-box problem of machine learning models which generate predicted
results without any explanation to support their judgment. Essentially, the
interpretability of stock prediction is salient, especially for stock traders and analysts.

In this competition, participants are expected to design a system that provides useful
information to investors that benefits their investment decision. The system is expected
to utilize various information including historical transactional data and financial news
to benefit the decision-making of investors. Participants are required to provide
profitable trading strategies based on historical market information. Especially, the
interpretability of predications is highly expected to assist the decision-makings for
stock traders and analysts.
